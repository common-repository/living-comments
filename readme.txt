= Why isn't it posting comments/replies automatically? =
If Living Comments isn't posting comments or replies automatically, it might be due to WP-Cron's reliance on site traffic to trigger scheduled tasks. For new websites with low traffic, WP-Cron may not run as expected, leading to delays. In such cases, configuring a system cron job could provide a more reliable solution, ensuring consistent and timely execution of scheduled comment and reply postings.

We release updates regularly to improve functionality, introduce new features, and address any security concerns that arise.
